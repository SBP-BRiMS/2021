					<b> StateSim: A Country Modeling and Systems Engineering Journey</b>
					<br>
					<b> Abstract </b>
					<p>This is a story of perseverance in country modeling through numerous failures peppered with an increasing number of successes over time. 
						It began 12 years ago with a DARPA “horse race” challenge to model the likely behavior of every country of the world. 
						The winners used statistical modeling (lagged regression) and extrapolated trends in black-box fashion. 
						With StateSim, we wanted to use causal agent-based models so one could study counterfactuals and different courses of action (COAs).
						We succeeded in hiring country desk experts to help us build models of four countries which passed rich validation tests. 
						However, we failed to do all countries since each country model took several months to produce, making global coverage unsustainable.
						We have addressed this challenge in two ways. 
						First, in the ensuing years we built 15 more country models and converted them into a “repository” of validated, reusable country modeling components (different types of leaders, followers, factions, institutions, resources, etc.). 
						Second, we have exploited the rise of “Big Data,” and the dozens of open social science data sources that cover many of the required parameters. Merging our repository of reusable parts with machine learning to scrape parameters from the open data sources created a needed breakthrough. 
						We have spent the past two years solidifying this breakthrough into a Rapid StateSim Model Generator. In trials in the USA, England, and Australia, Information Officers used the StateSim Generator to model various countries around the world and run them for numerous COA studies (in a 2-3 day window per country). 
						Of course, the validity of each country model’s projections vary as a function of (1) its coverage in the open source data, (2) the validity of what is in the open source data, and (3) the extent that the user tests and fine-tunes the model to ensure it corresponds with reality. 
						In sum, when statistical models predict a conflict, instability, or other scenario of interest, one must turn to causal models to study the “what-ifs” – direct, secondary, and tertiary impacts of COAs and policy choices. Sufficient progress (coverage, speed, ease of use, validity, etc) has occurred so that it is now becoming reasonably fast to build and run causal models of any country’s instability issues.</p>-->

His work continues in the modeling of various infrastructures and effects placed upon them and in the application of machine learning.<br/>Dr. Salerno received an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Mathematics in 1978 from Mohawk Valley Community College, his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in both Mathematics and Physics in 1980 from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Potsdam, a Masters in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) in 1984 from Syracuse University and his PhD from Binghamton University in 1997 in Computer Science.<br/>Dr Salerno has written over 80 published papers and reports, has been awarded four US patents and has received numerous awards.  Among which include: Special Achievement Award (Army); ESC Team Award; AFMC General (Ret) James Ferguson Engineering Award; R&D Team Award; and Rome Laboratory Engineer of the Year.  In 2005, Dr. Salerno became an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Fellow.</p>
						<h3>Talk title: "The Need to Understand the Populace's Action / Reactions:  A Walk Through of Selected Past Research"</h3>
						<p>Abstract: Governments exists to support the sovereignty of its nation - its borders and people.  Decisions by the government on behalf of the populace should be made with the "best" interest in meeting their populace's needs.  What are these needs?  What will keep them happy?   In this presentation we will provide motivation as to the need for answers and take a walk through a series of research activities that were pursued to explore such questions.  We conclude by discussing the need for continued research, the motivation for SBP and its importance to the community.</p>

						<h2>Eric Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP</h2>
						<h3><small>Medical doctor, CEO for Infinitum Humanitarian Systems (IHS), Research Professor in Environmental Security and Global Medicine at San Diego State University and instructor in disaster medicine at both the International Disaster Academy in Bonn, Germany (Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe) and the Institute for Disaster Preparedness in Beijing, China.</small></h3>
						<p>Eric Rasmussen is the CEO for Infinitum Humanitarian Systems (IHS), a multinational consulting group built on a profit-for-purpose model. He is an internal medicine physician with both undergraduate and medical degrees from Stanford University and a European Master’s degree in disaster medicine from the UN World Health Organization’s affiliate CEMEC (Centre European pour la Medecin des Catastrophes) in Italy. He was elected a Fellow of the American College of Physicians in 1997 and a Fellow of the Explorer's Club in 2014.<br/>Rasmussen is also a Research Professor in Environmental Security and Global Medicine at San Diego State University and an instructor in disaster medicine at both the International Disaster Academy in Bonn, Germany and the Institute for Disaster Preparedness at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. <br/>>He serves, pro bono, as the medical director for two biotech startups, and as pro bono CEO to an NGO specializing in anti-slavery/anti-trafficking efforts for refugees. He’s a Permanent Advisor to the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Expert Panel on Water Disasters and has been a member of the US National Academy of Science’s Committee on Grand Challenges in Global Development since 2012.<br/>He served in the US Navy for 25 years aboard nuclear submarines, amphibious ships, and aircraft carriers. His positions included Joint Task Force Surgeon (Forward) for the Hurricane Katrina response, Team Lead for the Banda Aceh Tsunami Response Team from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Fleet Surgeon for the US Navy’s Third Fleet, director of an Intensive Care Unit, and Chairman of an academic department of medicine in Seattle.<br/>His wartime deployments included Bosnia three times, Afghanistan twice, and Iraq for nine months. For a portion of his Navy career he was also a Principal Investigator in humanitarian informatics for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).<br/>After retiring from the Navy he was appointed the Founding CEO for the TED Prize awarded to Dr. Larry Brilliant, then Executive Director of Google.org.<br/>Since 2014 Rasmussen has also led the Global Disaster Response Team for the Roddenberry Foundation, supported by the Star Trek franchise and in partnership with MIT’s Lincoln Laboratories and Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. That team provides permanent water purification and renewable power to displaced populations and have deployed to Supertyphoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Nepal earthquake, Hurricane Mathew in Haiti, and three times to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.</p>
						<h3> Talk title: “Augmented Intelligence in the Humanitarian Space”</h3>
						<p> Abstract: As we end the second decade of the new century we note there are at least 65 million people in the world unwillingly displaced from their homes. Conflict, natural disaster, economic opportunity, climate change, environmental degradation, and cultural oppression all play roles, and the techniques we’ve previously used for detecting migration and then provisioning water, power, food, physical safety, communication, and identity are no longer able to provide anything close to what’s required. I lead a disaster response team for the Roddenberry Foundation, supported by the Star Trek franchise. As a consequence I’m in a position to consider, with help from a range of useful specialists, what machine learning, geospatial visualization, data analysis, algorithmic planning, and augmented intelligence might soon contribute to our improved effectiveness. We’ll also look at several real-world events, and examine what augmented intelligence is already contributing in the humanitarian sector.</p>
